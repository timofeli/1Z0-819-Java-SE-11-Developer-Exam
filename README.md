## OCP Java SE 11 Developer

Here comes my journey of taking OCP Java SE 11 Developer exam. 

In order to prepare for this I've used the following books:

OCP Oracle Certified Professional _Java SE 11 Developer_ Complete _Study Guide_: Exam _1Z0_-815, Exam _1Z0_-816, and Exam _1Z0_-819[Boyarsky, Jeanne, Selikoff, ... etc] plus questions dumps. 

I have to say that this exam is not an easy one, in fact it was so challenging that I have decided to add my own examples to each chapter of the last combined book with tests (yes, from Boyarsky and Selikoff) based on questions that I personally have found tricky. 

According to statiscs of this exam, about 25/50 questions cover the following topics: 

 - streams
 - collections
 - functional interfaces and interfaces in general
 - lambdas 

That's why you will find here more examples for these topics. 
I will also be analyzing questions from the dumps since most of them cover streams, collections and lambdas. 

I hope it's helpful :)
